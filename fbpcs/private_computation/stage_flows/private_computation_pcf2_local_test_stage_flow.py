    This enum lists all of the supported stage types and maps to their possible statuses.

    1. This is enum contains the flow - ID MATCH -> PREPARE -> PCF2_ATTRIBUTION -> PCF2_AGGREGATION -> SHARD AGGREGATION.
    2. The order in which the enum members appear is the order in which the stages are intended
    to run. The _order_ variable is used to ensure member order is consistent (class attribute, removed during class creation).
    An exception is raised at runtime if _order_ is inconsistent with the actual member order.
